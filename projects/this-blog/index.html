Hugo
Nothing really notable here, I needed something that could quickly take markdown content and generate a nice static website and Hugo fit that purpose. There are plenty of others out there but Hugo is written in go and the templating language I am already pretty familiar with. Learning Hugo has been pretty painless, there are lots of youtube vidoes available and the docs they provider are pretty decent."><title>badstreff.com

DNS configuration was a bit tricky, GitHub provides docs on setting a custom dns name but I found with Cloudflare I&rsquo;m unable to check the enforce HTTPS option. I was able to work around this by setting up a redirect rule in Cloudflare</p><p><img src=cloudflare-redirect-rule.PNG alt=redirect-rule></p><h3 id=github-actions>GitHub Actions</h3><p>There is a GitHub workflow that triggers action on pushes to the main branch to rebuild the website and update the <code>gh-pages</code> branch of the repository with the static content.
